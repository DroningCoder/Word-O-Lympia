# WORD-O-LYMPIA
## About
* **Word-O-Lympia** is an algorithm that searches for words in a grid of characters.
* A Depth-First-Search (DFS) is used for this purpose.
* It traverses all 8-directions for a position in the grid recursively while at the same time maintaining a **Trie Node pointer** to check if the word constructed so far is valid.
* A Trie is used to store all words of a dictionary so as to achieve **optimal** space efficiency (as compared to using a Hashmap).
