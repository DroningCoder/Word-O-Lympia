# WORD-O-LYMPIA
## About This Project:
* **Word-O-Lympia** is an algorithm that searches for words in a grid of characters.
* A Depth-First-Search (DFS) is used for this purpose.
* It traverses all 8-directions for a position in the grid recursively while at the same time maintaining a **Trie Node pointer** to check if the word constructed so far is valid.
* A Trie is used to store all words of a dictionary to achieve **optimal** space efficiency (as compared to using a Hashmap).

[Depth-First-Search(DFS)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph/)
## Pre-Requisite:
* Understanding Of Basics Of C++ Including OOP and STL
* Trie Data Structure
* Graph DFS
* Text File Handling
## Note:
To run this program correctly, make sure dictionary.txt is present in the directory where you will save your cpp file.
